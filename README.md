# masters-thesis-eeg-analysis

This repo contains the code for my master's thesis on Deep Learning for EEG Signal Analysis in Cognitive Decline Studies
The dataset used for this thesis is from [Open Neuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.8/download)
It contains code for all the models and my final thesis document.

1. Model 1: MLP and Random Forest with Feature Extraction
2. Model 2: ResNet1D
3. Model 3: Custom CNN with Attention Mechanism
