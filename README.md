# thesis-eeg-analysis

This repo contains the code for my master's thesis on Deep Learning for EEG Signal Analysis in Cognitive Decline Studies
The dataset used for this thesis is from [Open Neuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.8/download)
It contains code on -
1. EDA
2. Model 1: MLP with feature extraction
3. Model 2: ResNet1D
4. Model 3: Custom CNN with attention mechanism
